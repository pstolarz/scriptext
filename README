scriptext
=========

Among many WinDbg scripting language flaws is a complete lack of advanced text
searching/replacing functionality, especially associated with aliases. The library
provides simple, "s" sed like command to search and replace regexp patterns in
strings and WinDbg aliases. Together with WinDbg functionality of setting aliases
to arbitrary WinDbg commands outputs, the library provides an effective tool to
write advanced WinDbg scripts without a need to reach for Python substitutions.

Additionally the library supplies simple set of commands to open, read, write and
close text/binary files. Of course this ain't shell nor Python but for simple
scripts should be sufficient.

scriptext: Various scripting utilities

sxtr [-t num] input/pattern/replacement
    Look for a substring of the input string matching the extended POSIX RE pattern.
    If the pattern matches, the substring is extracted and modified according to
    the replacement string. The input string may contain alphanumeric characters
    plus '_' only, or must be enclosed in '' or "". If it's enclosed in [], then
    the input string specifies an alias name containing a string to process.
    Delimiter character is recognized as the first one after the input string. All
    the strings may contain escaped characters.
    -t: If specified, provides a pseudo-reg $t number where the matching result
        will be set: 0 - not matched, 1 - matched.

fopn [-m mode] [-t num] fname
    Open a file with a name fname.
    -m: Open mode (C standard). "r+" by default.
    -t: Pseudo-reg $t number where a handle of the opened file will be written. In
        case of opening error zero will be written there. If not specified $t0 is
        taken.
fwrt hndl input
    Write the input string to the file with the handle hndl. If the input string
    is enclosed in [] then it specifies an alias name containing a string to write.
    The input string may contain escaped characters.
frdl hndl
    Read line from a file with the handle hndl. The file shall be opened for read
    in the text mode.
fcls hndl
    Close a file with a handle hndl.

Compiling and Installing
------------------------

Prerequisites:
 - MS SDK with cl, link and nmake; no need for MS Visual Studio,
 - Debugging Tools for Windows (WinDbg) with its SDK,

Compilation:
 - Set required building environment depending on your target platform (x86/x64.
   debug/release etc.) by calling "SetEnv.Cmd" with proper arguments,
 - Inspect Makefile for your WinDbg debugger localization by setting WINDBG_DIR
   parameter and make the library:

   nmake

 - The result is scriptext.dll library located in the sources directory. Install it
   by:

   nmake install

Loading and testing
-------------------

In WinDbg command window put:

0:000> .load scriptext

Help info:

0:000> !scriptext.help

Create test_alias, look for "test" string in it and replace by "TEST". $t0 pseudo
register is set to 1 (the searched string is found in the alias).

0:000> aS test_alias "Let's try test"

0:000> al
  Alias            Value  
 -------          ------- 
 test_alias       Let's try test 

0:000> !sxtr -t 0 [test_alias]/(.*)test(.*)/\1TEST\2
Let's try TEST

0:000> r @$t0
$t0=0000000000000001
